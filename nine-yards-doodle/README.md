Nine Yards Doodle is a whiteboard app originally desigined for the [Nine Yards](../README.md) project management tool but due to how useful we found it during development can be ran seperately. Locally in the browser as a PWA, or hosted for collabirative drawing. In addition Nine Yards Doodle can be used as a framework agnostic web component to embed it into your own projects.
